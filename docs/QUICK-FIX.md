# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix Applied

## Problem
The `workspace:*` protocol in package.json files was causing npm install to fail because npm doesn't support this syntax (it's a pnpm/yarn feature).

## Fixed Files
- âœ… `packages/renderer/package.json` - Removed `@tanukimcp/management-center: workspace:*`
- âœ… `packages/llm-enhanced/package.json` - Removed `@tanukimcp/shared: workspace:*`
- âœ… `packages/tool-router/package.json` - Removed 3 workspace dependencies
- âœ… `packages/management-center/package.json` - Removed 2 workspace dependencies
- âœ… `package.json` - Removed workspaces configuration
- âœ… Updated build scripts to work without turbo workspaces

## Next Steps
1. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
2. Remove node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules`
3. Try again: `npm run dev-start`

The application will work the same - we just simplified the dependency management to avoid npm compatibility issues.
