# TanukiMCP Atlas Toolbar Architecture

This document outlines the architecture, behavior, visual feedback, and user experience for the main toolbar and its associated application views within TanukiMCP Atlas.

## 1. Toolbar Philosophy

The TanukiMCP Atlas UI features a two-tier toolbar system:

1.  **Primary Menu Bar (Top)**: Contains global application menus (File, Edit, View, Tools, Help), the brand logo, theme switcher, and the Subject Mode dropdown. This bar is persistent and provides access to core functionalities and settings.
2.  **Secondary Toolbar (Contextual)**: Appears below the Primary Menu Bar and provides context-specific controls based on the active view or tool. For example, when the Chat view is active, this toolbar contains controls for `Agent Mode`, `Chat Mode`, `Stop`, and `@Tools`.

## 2. Layout Management

The application will adopt a flexible and responsive layout system, inspired by modern IDEs like Cursor.

*   **Main Content Area**: This is the primary workspace where different views (Editor, Chat, Workflow Manager, Settings, etc.) will be displayed.
*   **Sidebar(s)**:
    *   **Left Sidebar (File Explorer/Project View)**: Persistently available for project navigation. Can be toggled.
    *   **Right Sidebar (Contextual Panels)**: Used for displaying auxiliary information like tool outputs, debugger info, or specific settings related to the active view. Can be toggled and resized.
*   **Split Views**:
    *   The main content area should support splitting horizontally and vertically to display multiple views simultaneously (e.g., Editor side-by-side with Chat, or Editor above Terminal).
    *   Proportions of split panes should be user-adjustable via draggable dividers.
    *   When a file is selected from the File Explorer, it should open in a new tab or an existing split pane within the main content area. The Chat view should remain accessible, potentially in another split pane below or beside the editor.
*   **Tabbed Interface**: For views like the Editor, multiple files should open in tabs for easy switching.
*   **Full Screen Occupancy**: The entire application interface, including toolbars, sidebars, and the main content area, should utilize the full available screen space, eliminating any unintentional empty margins or unused areas.

    *   Maintain consistency in button styles, input fields, and overall component design.
    *   Use subtle animations for interactions (hover, click, focus) to provide feedback without being distracting.
    *   Transitions between views should be smooth (e.g., fade, subtle slide).

## 6. Implementation Strategy (Modular & Sequential)

1.  **Core Layout System**: Implement the main application frame, sidebars (toggleable), and basic main content area. Ensure it fills the screen.
2.  **Theme Engine**: Refine the light and dark themes, especially the light theme to match `tanukimcp.com` (burnt orange, beige). Ensure theme switching works flawlessly.
3.  **View Routing/Management**: Set up a basic mechanism to switch between different primary views in the main content area (e.g., Welcome, Chat, Editor placeholder, Settings placeholder).
4.  **Primary Menu Bar - Static Structure**: Build the static structure of the menu bar with all defined items and dropdowns. Initially, actions can be `console.log` placeholders.
5.  **File Menu Implementation**:
    *   Implement "Settings" to navigate to a placeholder Settings view.
6.  **View Menu Implementation**:
    *   Implement "Toggle File Explorer".
    *   Implement basic zoom (if feasible without a full editor).
7.  **Tools Menu Implementation**:
    *   Implement "Workflow Manager" to navigate to the (currently buggy) Workflow Manager view.
    *   Implement "LLM Prompt Management" to navigate to a placeholder view.
8.  **Help Menu Implementation**:
    *   Implement "About TanukiMCP Atlas".
9.  **File Editor Integration**:
    *   Integrate a basic code editor component (e.g., Monaco).
    *   Implement file opening from File Explorer into the editor (tabs or splits).
    *   Connect "Edit" menu actions (Cut, Copy, Paste, Find) to the editor.
10. **Chat View Integration**:
    *   Ensure chat view can be displayed alongside or below the editor using the split-pane system.
    *   Connect "New Chat" and "Save Chat".
11. **Contextual Toolbar - Chat**: Implement the secondary toolbar for the Chat view with its specific controls.
12. **Refine Workflow Manager**: Address existing bugs and integrate it properly within the new layout system. Implement its contextual toolbar.
13. **Sequential Feature Rollout**: Implement remaining menu actions one by one, building out their respective views or functionalities.
14. **Animations & Polish**: Add defined animations, transitions, and UX refinements across the application.
15. **Testing & Iteration**: Thoroughly test all functionalities and UI interactions.

This document will serve as the guide for these development steps.
