# TanukiMCP: Atlas - Project Overview

## üéØ Project Vision
**TanukiMCP: Atlas** is a free, local, AI-powered desktop IDE that combines the power of Ollama-hosted open-source LLMs with sophisticated tool management and methodical task execution capabilities. It addresses the high costs and complexity of cloud-based AI development tools by providing a self-contained, extensible development environment.

## üìã Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
- **Local & Free**: Eliminate dependency on expensive cloud LLM APIs
- **Self-Contained IDE**: Complete development environment with file management
- **Intelligent Task Management**: Structured todolist-based approach to complex tasks
- **Tool-Powered LLMs**: Enhanced capabilities through comprehensive tool integration
- **Extensible Architecture**: MCP client hub for community extensions
- **Professional UX**: Modern, clean interface competitive with Cursor/Windsurf

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Developers frustrated with Cursor/Windsurf costs and limitations
- **Secondary**: AI enthusiasts wanting local LLM control
- **Tertiary**: Teams needing private, on-premise AI development tools

## üöÄ Competitive Positioning

### vs. Cursor/Windsurf
**Advantages**:
- ‚úÖ Free to use (no API costs)
- ‚úÖ Complete privacy (local processing)
- ‚úÖ Systematic task execution (todolist approach)
- ‚úÖ Extensible tool system
- ‚úÖ Multiple LLM support

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚ùå Requires local compute power
- ‚ùå Limited by local model capabilities
- ‚ùå Initial setup complexity

### vs. Claude Desktop + MCP
**Advantages**:
- ‚úÖ Integrated development environment
- ‚úÖ Visual file management
- ‚úÖ Intelligent tool selection
- ‚úÖ Built-in task management
- ‚úÖ No subscription required

### Unique Value Propositions
1. **Methodical Task Execution**: Todolist-based approach ensures complex tasks are completed systematically
2. **Tool Selection Intelligence**: Pre-processing layer improves reliability and reduces token usage
3. **Local + Free**: Combines power of local LLMs with sophisticated development environment
4. **Extensible Architecture**: MCP hub allows unlimited capability expansion

## üìù Development Priorities
1. **Core Functionality First**: Focus on basic IDE capabilities before advanced features
2. **User Experience**: Smooth, responsive UI is critical for adoption
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for setup and usage
4. **Community**: Build ecosystem around extensibility

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation
- **Ollama Dependency**: Provide fallback options if Ollama is unavailable
- **Model Performance**: Set appropriate expectations for local vs. cloud models
- **Complexity Management**: Progressive disclosure of advanced features
- **Resource Usage**: Optimize for lower-end hardware compatibility
