# TanukiMCP: Atlas - Project Overview

## üéØ Project Vision
**TanukiMCP: Atlas** is an Intelligence Amplification Platform that transforms any LLM into a superintelligent agent through sophisticated tool orchestration, contextual enhancement, and intelligent reasoning frameworks. Rather than relying on massive models, Atlas proves that smaller, efficient LLMs equipped with the right tools and guidance can outperform much larger models at a fraction of the cost.

## üìã Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
- **Intelligence Amplification**: Transform small LLMs into high-performance agents through tool orchestration
- **Built-in Enhancement Stack**: Context7, Mem0, LangChain, and reasoning tools as core architecture
- **Intelligent Request Routing**: Hidden LLM layers classify and route requests for optimal processing
- **Agent Orchestration**: Sophisticated handoff protocols with memory persistence between sessions
- **Hybrid Deployment**: Seamless switching between local (free) and remote (enhanced) processing
- **Flat-Rate Pricing**: Monthly subscriptions for unlimited usage, no per-token charges

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Developers frustrated with Cursor/Windsurf costs and limitations
- **Secondary**: AI enthusiasts wanting local LLM control
- **Tertiary**: Teams needing private, on-premise AI development tools

## üöÄ Competitive Positioning

### vs. Cursor/Windsurf/Claude
**Revolutionary Advantages**:
- ‚úÖ **Intelligence Amplification**: 7B models perform like 70B+ models through tool enhancement
- ‚úÖ **Built-in Context Management**: Context7 + Mem0 integration for superior code understanding
- ‚úÖ **Agent Orchestration**: Multi-agent handoffs with persistent memory between sessions
- ‚úÖ **Flat-Rate Pricing**: $29-79/month unlimited vs. $20-100+ variable costs
- ‚úÖ **Hybrid Deployment**: Local privacy + remote power when needed
- ‚úÖ **Subject Mode Specialization**: Math, Code, Science, Language experts built-in

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚ùå Requires local compute power
- ‚ùå Limited by local model capabilities
- ‚ùå Initial setup complexity

### vs. Claude Desktop + MCP
**Advantages**:
- ‚úÖ Integrated development environment
- ‚úÖ Visual file management
- ‚úÖ Intelligent tool selection
- ‚úÖ Built-in task management
- ‚úÖ No subscription required

### Unique Value Propositions
1. **Methodical Task Execution**: Todolist-based approach ensures complex tasks are completed systematically
2. **Tool Selection Intelligence**: Pre-processing layer improves reliability and reduces token usage
3. **Local + Free**: Combines power of local LLMs with sophisticated development environment
4. **Extensible Architecture**: MCP hub allows unlimited capability expansion

## üìù Development Priorities
1. **Core Functionality First**: Focus on basic IDE capabilities before advanced features
2. **User Experience**: Smooth, responsive UI is critical for adoption
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for setup and usage
4. **Community**: Build ecosystem around extensibility

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation
- **Ollama Dependency**: Provide fallback options if Ollama is unavailable
- **Model Performance**: Set appropriate expectations for local vs. cloud models
- **Complexity Management**: Progressive disclosure of advanced features
- **Resource Usage**: Optimize for lower-end hardware compatibility
