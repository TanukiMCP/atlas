# TanukiMCP Atlas - Revolutionary AI Orchestration Platform
## Implementation Roadmap: From Foundation to Industry-Disrupting Platform

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

**Current State:** TanukiMCP Atlas has a foundational architecture.

**Transformation Goal:** Evolve into a **dynamic AI orchestration platform** that intelligently combines local and remote models to create workflows that enable LLMs of varying sizes to become highly capable, context-aware assistants. This includes dynamic operator profile assignment, Python-based Intelligence Amplification Engines (IAEs) for reliable computation and validation, user collaboration mechanisms, and a visual workflow builder.

**Revolutionary Vision:**
- **Intelligent Context-Aware Self-Orchestrated Workflows**: LLM-driven dynamic workflow generation based on user requests and assigned operator profiles.
- **Visual Workflow Builder**: A drag-and-drop node-based interface where users can see the LLM construct workflows, interact with the process via an integrated chat, and collaborate on workflow design.
- **Python-Based IAEs & Dynamic Validation**: LLMs utilize modular Python engines for computation and validation, with expert-tier capabilities to research (web_search) and write custom validation scripts.
- **Dynamic Operator Profiles & Subject Modes**: LLMs generate and adapt their own operator profiles based on the task and selected subject modes (e.g., biology, physics, general) to enhance cognitive capabilities.
- **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Failsafe mechanisms for LLMs to pause and request user collaboration when validation is uncertain or tasks are exceptionally complex.
- **Transparent Intelligence**: Real-time display of the LLM's "thinking process," workflow construction, and tool usage.
- **FREE-FIRST Philosophy & Comprehensive Model Management**: Leverage OpenRouter and local Ollama models, with systems for model discovery, capability mapping, and assignment to workflow nodes based on strengths/weaknesses.
- **Community Learning**: Anonymized data collection to improve orchestration strategies and model performance for all users.

## ðŸ”µ PHASE 1: Foundations of Intelligent Orchestration & Visual Workflow
*Establish the core dynamic workflow engine, initial orchestration logic, and the visual interface for workflow construction and interaction.*

**Overall Goal:** Build the foundational components that allow an LLM to analyze a request, propose a workflow, and visualize this process for the user, enabling initial interaction.

### Task 1.1: Core Orchestration Router Agent
**File:** `src/orchestration/OrchestrationRouter.ts` (or new appropriate structure)
**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Design core LLM (e.g., fast local model) as the initial orchestration conductor.
- [ ] Implement initial request analysis to determine basic complexity (e.g., Atomic, Moderate, Complex, Expert as per user notes).
- [ ] **LLM-driven Operator Profile Assignment (Basic):** Implement logic for the orchestrator LLM to assign a preliminary operator profile to the request. This profile will be simple initially and expanded in Phase 2.
- [ ] **Contextual Decision Making (Basic):** Allow the orchestrator LLM to make a basic determination if web access might be needed for context or if training data is sufficient (to be expanded with `web_search` tool in Phase 2).
- [ ] Implement logic for the orchestrator agent to generate a preliminary workflow definition based on the user's request and the assigned operator profile.
- [ ] Create basic agent assignment logic (mapping to broader capability categories).
- [ ] Basic tool availability assessment.

### Task 1.2: Dynamic Workflow Engine (Initial Version)
**File:** `src/orchestration/WorkflowEngine.ts` (or new appropriate structure)
**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Create a LangChain-based (or similar framework) workflow execution engine.
- [ ] Implement basic agent handoff with context preservation for simple sequential workflows.
- [ ] **Workflow Node Definition (Initial):** Define a structure for workflow nodes that includes instructions (what the node does, how it does it) and placeholders for validation criteria (to be fully implemented in Phase 2).
- [ ] Agent starts workflow by defining current state/start node, and a conceptual end state/node.

### Task 1.3: Visual Workflow Builder & Integrated Chat (Foundation)
**Files:** `packages/renderer/src/components/WorkflowBuilder/` (new or existing UI components)
**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Design and implement a basic visual drag-and-drop, node-based builder interface.
- [ ] **Visual Animation of LLM Planning:** Implement functionality to visually represent the LLM formulating a branched workflow (e.g., nodes appearing sequentially as the LLM "thinks").
- [ ] Allow users to view the workflow as it's being constructed by the LLM.
- [ ] **Integrated Chatbox:** Implement a functional chatbox *within* the visual workflow builder interface. This chatbox serves as a direct line of communication to the agent constructing the workflow.
- [ ] Basic user interaction: Allow users to pause the workflow generation.

### Task 1.4: Initial Complexity Tiers (Definition & Basic Handling)
**Files:** `src/orchestration/ComplexityRouter.ts` (or integrated into OrchestrationRouter)
**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Define the initial structure for complexity tiers based on user notes:
    - **Atomic:** Direct Response (NO tools).
    - **Moderate:** Thinking tools but NO custom validation scripts (IAEs to be added in Phase 2).
    - **Expert (Placeholder):** Full thinking + execution + custom validation (placeholder, full implementation in Phase 2/3).
- [ ] Implement basic routing based on initial complexity assessment from Task 1.1.

---

## ðŸŸ¡ PHASE 2: Advanced Agent Capabilities, IAEs, and Dynamic Context
*Enhance agents with sophisticated reasoning, custom tool creation capabilities, and dynamic contextual understanding through operator profiles and subject modes.*

**Overall Goal:** Equip LLMs with the tools and intelligence to handle more complex tasks, including custom validation and a deeper understanding of their operational context.

### Task 2.1: Python-based Intelligence Amplification Engines (IAEs)
**Package:** `packages/iae-engines` (new package)
**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Design and implement a framework for modular Python-based computational engines (IAEs).
- [ ] These engines are exposed as tools that LLMs can utilize for reliable computation, planning stage steps, individual node-level execution, or result validation.
- [ ] Develop an initial set of IAEs for common tasks (e.g., basic calculations, data transformations).
- [ ] **IAE Mapping:** LLM determines how to map available IAEs to workflow nodes.

### Task 2.2: Expert Tier - Dynamic Validation Script Generation
**Files:** `src/orchestration/ExpertProcessor.ts`, `src/tools/PythonExecutionTool.ts` (new or existing)
**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] **Virtual Python Environment:** For "Expert" complexity tasks, allow the LLM to operate within a temporary, sandboxed Python environment.
- [ ] **Web Search Integration:** Integrate the `web_search` tool, enabling the LLM to research methodologies for validation across diverse fields (life sciences, math, etc.).
- [ ] **Custom Validation Scripting:** Enable the LLM to write its own temporary Python validation scripts based on its research and the task requirements.
- [ ] The LLM can iterate, run these scripts within the virtual environment, and verify results.
- [ ] **Display Computations:** Display the results of these computations in the chat or relevant UI.
- [ ] **Temporary Environment Management:** Ensure the temporary Python environment is properly managed and deleted after use.
- [ ] Option to "save computational engine" (prototype for Phase 4 refinement).

### Task 2.3: Advanced Operator Profiles & Subject Modes
**Files:** `src/orchestration/OperatorProfileManager.ts`, `src/ipcHandlers.ts`
**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] **LLM-Generated Operator Profile Context:** Implement the logic (potentially using a dedicated LLM call) for an LLM to generate rich operator profile context.
- [ ] This context is dynamically injected into the main chat LLM's system prompt or overall operational context.
- [ ] **Subject Modes:** Develop a system for "subject modes" (e.g., General, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Art, Literature, Language Tutor).
- [ ] Selecting a subject mode dynamically adjusts the LLM's system prompt/operator profile using the LLM-generated context to enhance cognitive capabilities in that specific field.
- [ ] Ensure operator profiles can be fully added or removed based on user settings or task requirements.
- [ ] **Modular Injection:** Operator profile context and IAEs should be modularly injectable into the agent's thinking process.

### Task 2.4: Enhanced Workflow Node Definition & Validation
**Files:** `src/orchestration/WorkflowEngine.ts`, UI components
**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] **Explicit Node Instructions:** Each node in the workflow must have clearly defined planning, execution, and validation criteria. The agent generating the workflow is responsible for defining these.
- [ ] **Agent-Driven Validation:** The agent itself determines and verifies that complete workflow execution and validation has met the success criteria for each node and the overall workflow.
- [ ] **No Pointless Workflows:** The agent should aim to generate a meaningful summary or result upon workflow completion.
- [ ] **Failsafe for Validation & Collaboration:**
    - If the agent determines success criteria cannot be validated (with existing IAEs or custom scripts), implement a "pause" mechanism.
    - The system should clearly communicate this to the user and request collaboration.
    - User should be able to interact (e.g., via the integrated chat) to refine criteria or approve continuation.

### Task 2.5: Refined Complexity Tier - "Complex"
**Files:** `src/orchestration/ComplexityRouter.ts`, `src/processors/ComplexProcessor.ts`
**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Solidify the "Complex" tier: Allows thinking + execution capabilities (e.g., using IAEs and more complex tool chains), but *without* the LLM writing its own custom validation scripts (that's for "Expert").
- [ ] Differentiate from "Moderate" (which might use simpler tools/IAEs without deep execution chains).

---

## ðŸŸ¢ PHASE 3: Comprehensive Model Management, UI/UX Refinements, and Collaboration
*Integrate a broader range of models, implement the transparent thinking display, and refine user collaboration within the workflow builder.*

**Overall Goal:** Create a seamless user experience with access to diverse models, clear insight into the AI's processes, and robust collaborative tools.

### Task 3.1: OpenRouter Integration & Unified Model Registry (Initial)
**Package:** `packages/llm-enhanced`, `src/services/OpenRouterService.ts`, `src/services/ModelRegistry.ts`
**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Implement OpenRouter API integration with authentication.
- [ ] Create free model discovery and filtering system from OpenRouter.
- [ ] Add model capability mapping (basic strengths/weaknesses) and performance tracking for OpenRouter models.
- [ ] Create an initial unified registry for remote (OpenRouter) models.
- [ ] **Model Assignment per Node (User Linking):**
    - Allow users to link specific models from the OpenRouter model hub to individual nodes within the workflow builder.
    - The system should cache LLM-assigned strengths/weakness profiles for these available/linked models.
    - The orchestrator/agent LLM uses this information to guide which available LLM is best suited for a given node's task.

### Task 3.2: Transparent Thinking Display
**Files:** `packages/renderer/src/components/ThinkingDisplay/`
**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Design and implement a collapsible thinking process visualization (Cursor-style agentic chat animations).
- [ ] Show the LLM's thought chain, sequential tool calls, and file-operation visual diffs (if applicable).
- [ ] Implement real-time workflow progress display within this visualization.
- [ ] Create agent chain visualization with handoff indicators.
- [ ] Add tool execution cards with expandable details.
- [ ] Implement confidence indicators and success metrics as determined by the agent.

### Task 3.3: Enhanced Visual Workflow Builder & Collaboration
**Files:** `packages/renderer/src/components/WorkflowBuilder/`, UI components
**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] **Full User Collaboration:**
    - Allow users to edit, delete, or add nodes to the workflow generated by the LLM.
    - Users can agree upon the workflow or suggest modifications directly in the visual builder.
    - The agent should be ables to understand and adapt to these user-driven changes.
- [ ] **Workflow Editing Capabilities:** Provide robust tools for users to directly manipulate the workflow.
- [ ] **Start/End State Definition:** Agents always start workflows by first defining the current state/start node, then the end state upon validation, then build the "in-between" steps. This process should be clear to the user.
- [ ] **User Approval for Execution:** After a user collaborates on or approves a workflow, the agent should then proceed to actually execute it.

### Task 3.4: Chat UI Enhancements (Cursor-Style)
**Files:** `packages/renderer/src/components/Chat/`
**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Replicate Cursor-style agentic chat animations (thought chain, tool calls, etc. â€“ links to Task 3.2).
- [ ] Implement a working "@" tool selector for files, directories, and available tools/IAEs.
- [ ] Add a token-usage indicator with guidance.
- [ ] Implement a media-upload button (placeholder if full functionality is later).
- [ ] Hide send button while generating, show a stop button instead.
- [ ] Place Agent/Chat toggle and Stop button inside the chat container.

    - Animated "Install" button for models from Ollama library.
    - Pop-up dialog upon install completion with instructions for activating the model in Atlas and a "Don't ask again" option.
- [ ] **Advanced Unified Model Registry:** Extend the registry to include local models, with full capability standardization, comparison, performance benchmarking, and ranking.
- [ ] Model recommendation engine based on task requirements, considering both local and remote options.

## ðŸš€ Validation and Success

**Validation Pattern (Maintain existing and expand):**
```bash
npm run dev
# Electron app opens
# Use DevTools Console (Ctrl+Shift+I) for IPC testing:
# await window.electronAPI.invoke('channel-name', params)
# Examples:
# await window.electronAPI.invoke('orchestration:analyzeAndGenerateWorkflow', { content: 'Plan a research paper on quantum entanglement and write the abstract.' });
# await window.electronAPI.invoke('workflow:execute', { workflowId: 'generated-workflow-id', ... });
# await window.electronAPI.invoke('models:listAll', { includeLocal: true, includeRemote: true });
```

**Success Criteria for Industry Disruption (Adapted):**
- **Intelligent Orchestration:** Platform demonstrably enables LLMs to create and execute complex, validated workflows that solve user problems more reliably than standalone LLM interactions.
- **Enhanced Capabilities:** LLMs (even smaller ones) significantly improve their reasoning, computation, and validation abilities through IAEs and dynamic context.
- **User Empowerment:** Visual workflow builder and collaborative tools allow users to understand, guide, and co-create solutions with AI.
- **Cost-Efficiency & Accessibility:** Effective use of free/local models makes advanced AI capabilities accessible.
- **Reliability:** Hallucinations are significantly reduced through structured validation and IAEs.

This consolidated roadmap aims to guide the development of TanukiMCP Atlas into the visionary platform you've described.
