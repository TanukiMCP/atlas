- [x] Clean references from IPC handlers
- [x] Update chat services to remove legacy integration
- [x] Scrub all comments mentioning legacy systems
- [x] Update sample data to use OpenRouter examples only

## Next Steps
The codebase is now ready for feature development with a clean OpenRouter-only foundation.

## Phase 1: Critical Stability Fixes ✅ COMPLETED

### 1.1 Fix React Errors ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Fixed ModelManagementHub TypeError with defensive programming
- [x] Added default props and null checks for installations, configurations
- [x] Updated .gitignore with comprehensive exclusions

### 1.2 Remove Duplicate Files ✅ COMPLETED  
- [x] Deleted 6 old component versions (*-old.tsx files)
- [x] Removed outdated EnhancedChatInterface.tsx with Ollama dependencies
- [x] Removed outdated enhanced-chat-service.ts with Ollama imports

### 1.3 OpenRouter Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Removed Ollama service files per OpenRouter-only requirement
- [x] Updated UI components to show "OpenRouter" instead of "Ollama"
- [x] Fixed LLM status component to use correct FreeModel properties
- [x] Updated Settings, About, and Welcome views for OpenRouter
- [x] Cleaned up chat interfaces and error messages
- [x] Updated development script for OpenRouter guidance
- [x] Removed unused isOllamaConnected state variable
- [x] Updated mock file tree to reflect current services
- [x] Updated key documentation files (DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md, README.md)

## OpenRouter Integration Status ✅ FUNCTIONAL
- ✅ OpenRouter service implementation complete
- ✅ IPC handlers for OpenRouter operations
- ✅ LLM store updated for OpenRouter
- ✅ Settings UI for API key management
- ✅ Free model support (Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, Phi-3 Mini, Mistral 7B)
- ✅ Chat interfaces using OpenRouter through LLM store

## Next Steps (Phase 2-4)
1. Architecture standardization (weeks 1-2)
2. Infrastructure cleanup (weeks 2-3) 
3. Quality & documentation (weeks 3-4)

## Summary
Phase 1 critical fixes are complete. The application now:
- Uses OpenRouter exclusively (no Ollama dependencies)
- Has defensive programming to prevent React errors
- Clean codebase with duplicate files removed
- Updated UI and documentation reflecting OpenRouter-only approach

## Phase 2: Architecture Standardization (IN PROGRESS)
### 2.1 Remove Remaining Ollama References
- [ ] Update package.json to remove ollama dependency
- [ ] Clean Ollama references from IPC handlers
- [ ] Update chat services to remove Ollama integration
- [ ] Clean model manager and optimization engine
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect OpenRouter-only approach

### 2.2 Standardize Component Architecture
- [ ] Implement consistent error boundaries
- [ ] Standardize on shadcn/ui components
- [ ] Create centralized state management with Context API
- [ ] Establish consistent service layer pattern

## Phase 3: Infrastructure Cleanup
- [ ] Remove dist/ directory from repository
- [ ] Consolidate configuration files
- [ ] Implement automated linting (ESLint + Prettier)
- [ ] Set up automated testing framework
- [ ] Create proper build pipeline

## Phase 4: Quality & Documentation
- [ ] Establish consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Add comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Create component documentation
- [ ] Implement testing strategy
- [ ] Add code quality metrics
