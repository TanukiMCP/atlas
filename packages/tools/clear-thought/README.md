# Clear Thought Tools - Atlas Integration

## Overview

This package integrates the Clear Thought MCP Server tools into TanukiMCP Atlas, providing sophisticated thinking frameworks and mental models to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities for tasks above Tier 2 complexity.

## Architecture Integration

### Tier Integration
- **Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Basic Clear Thought tools for multi-step reasoning
- **Tier 4 (Complex)**: Full Clear Thought suite with collaborative reasoning and scientific method

### Available Tools

#### Core Thinking Tools
1. **Sequential Thinking** - Structured thought processes with revision support
2. **Mental Models** - First principles, opportunity cost, error propagation, etc.
3. **Design Patterns** - Modular architecture, API integration, security patterns
4. **Programming Paradigms** - OOP, functional, reactive, concurrent programming
5. **Debugging Approaches** - Binary search, reverse engineering, divide & conquer

#### Advanced Reasoning Tools  
6. **Collaborative Reasoning** - Multi-persona problem solving
7. **Decision Framework** - Structured decision analysis with criteria weighting
8. **Metacognitive Monitoring** - Knowledge boundary assessment and bias detection
9. **Scientific Method** - Hypothesis testing and empirical investigation
10. **Structured Argumentation** - Formal dialectical reasoning

#### Specialized Tools
11. **Visual Reasoning** - Diagrammatic representation and spatial analysis

### Usage in Atlas

```typescript
// Automatic integration in Tier 3+ processors
const clearThoughtRouter = new ClearThoughtRouter();

// Tier 3: Basic reasoning enhancement
if (requestComplexity >= 3) {
  const thinkingTools = clearThoughtRouter.selectToolsForTask(task);
  // Apply sequential thinking, mental models, design patterns
}

// Tier 4: Full reasoning suite
if (requestComplexity >= 4) {
  const advancedTools = clearThoughtRouter.getAdvancedToolset();
  // Apply collaborative reasoning, scientific method, etc.
}
```

## Integration Benefits

- **Enhanced Reasoning**: Systematic frameworks improve LLM logical capabilities
- **Structured Problem Solving**: Mental models provide clear analysis pathways  
- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple reasoning approaches validate solutions
- **Local Operation**: 100% private, no external API dependencies
- **Seamless Integration**: Transparent enhancement for complex tasks
